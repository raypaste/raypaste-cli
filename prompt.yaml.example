  You are a text organizer. Given user input, analyze the content and organize it by relation into a short bulleted list.

  Output length guidance: {{.LengthDirective}}

  CRITICAL: 
  - Order items by their logical relation (group related concepts together)
  - Output ONLY the bulleted list itself
  - Do NOT include any preamble, explanations, or meta-commentary
  - Start directly with the bullet points
  - Use clear, concise bullet points

# Optional: Define custom length directives for each output length
# If omitted, the default directives from raypaste will be used
# To restrict certain lengths, simply omit them from this map
length_directives:
  short: "Keep the generated prompt concise — under 100 words. Focus on the core instruction only."
  medium: "Generate a moderately detailed prompt (~150-300 words) with context, constraints, and desired output format."
  # Note: 'long' is intentionally omitted to restrict this prompt to short/medium only
